# <i class="fa fa-book fa-fw"></i>  About #

I'm a third year undergraduate student. My research interest includes SE, Knowledge Graph, and LLM.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Qing Huang of JXSE Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://jxselab.com/), Jiangxi Normal University. I am also fortunate to be working under the supervision of Professor Xing Zhenchang from CSIRO's Data61.
