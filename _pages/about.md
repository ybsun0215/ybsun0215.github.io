# <i class="fa fa-book fa-fw"></i>  About #

I am a first-year Ph.D. student majoring in Software Engineering at Tianjin University, with a research focus on software engineering and software security. 
I am fortunate to be conducting my research under the supervision of Prof. [Junjie Wang](https://zhunki.github.io/) and Prof. [Xiaohong Li](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/lxh/index-english.html).
I was very fortunate to have previously worked under the joint supervision of Professor Qing Huang of the [JXSE Lab](https://www.jxselab.com/) and Professor [Zhenchang Xing](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0vCxuH4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) of CSIRO Data61.
